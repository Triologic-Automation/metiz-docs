### Irrigation Frost Protection

<div class="imgSized0">
  ![Freeze Alarm Setting](/img/operator_panel/freeze_alarm.png)
</div>

In the settings, you can set the activation temperature for the automatic deflation (frost protection) of the irrigation system. This function will be deactivated at a certain hysteresis which can also be adjusted in this window.
If the outside temperature is under a defined limit the freeze protection program will be activated. Then the main drainage valve opens after the irrigation cycle. If the temperature is higher than the outside temperature limit + the defined hysteresis, the function will be disabled by automatic mode.
This function is active, if the irrigation valves are in automatic mode. 

1. Set minimum temperature [°C]
2. Hysteresis freeze control [°C]
