The higher the value (Attention - negative numbers!), the better the received signal. Limit values:

| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| \<= -100dBm | -90dBm     | Very poor signal strength |
| -90dBm      | -80dBm     | Poor signal strength      |
| -80dBm      | -70dBm     | Medium signal strength    |
| -70dBm      | -60dBm     | Good signal strength      |
