[**`Metiz`**](https://metiz.triologic.at) can be considered a type of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. SCADA systems are used for monitoring and controlling industrial processes, and Metiz fits this description as it allows users to monitor and control environmental parameters such as temperature, aeration, and irrigation in composting systems.

This documentation will describe the fundamentals of using the Metiz system. This includes the widgets displayed on the facility pages as well as core components.
