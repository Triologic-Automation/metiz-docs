---

In order to be able to use Metiz optimally, we recommend the use of an up-to-date web browser. Metiz was tested primarily with **Chrome, Safari and Firefox**. With all other web browsers, there may be deviations in the presentation and functionality.

For mobile applications, we recommend devices with the Android and IOS operating system and the above-mentioned web browsers. Again, there may be deviations in presentation and functionality when used in a different software environment.
